Infrastructure-as-code repository that enables GitOps for the "Blennies"
projects. Primarily, it automates the creation of GitHub repositories with
consistent settings.

Uses HCL configuration files. Designed for use with [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/).

## Getting started

Ensure the latest version of [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) is installed.

OpenTofu needs suitable access to this repository's origin on GitHub in order
to function correctly. You can achieve this by authenticating an account with
suitable permissions via the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) tool.

To prepare OpenTofu to manage the infrastructure:

```sh
tofu init
```

To generate an infrastructure plan and then apply it:

```sh
tofu plan
tofu apply
```

To verify changes to the infrastructure code:

```sh
tofu fmt --recursive
tofu validate
```

Verification of the infrastructure code is also performed by the CI flow.
Commit logs are checked for
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
compliance as part of this flow.
